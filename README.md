This project simulates and investigates neutron transport inside different slabs of material. 
The emissions, energy consumption and power of the transmission, reflection and absorbsion rates function (plot_T_A_R_thicknesses) has been estimated with CodeCarbon, and the results summarised in Jupyter notebook emission_tracking.ipynb
