This project simulates and investigates neutron transport inside different slabs of material, implemented in the Project_3_11020606.ipynb notebook. The emissions, energy consumption and power of the transmission, reflection and absorbsion rates function (plot_T_A_R_thicknesses) in this notebook has been estimated with CodeCarbon, and the results summarised in Jupyter notebook emission_tracking.ipynb

Raw data collected using CodeCarbon is stored in .csv files with filenames formatted as "XXXXXX_neutron_penetration_emissions_NNNNN.csv", where "XXXXXX" represents the date that the data was collected, and "NNNNN" is the number of neutrons simulated, corresponding to the 2nd argument in the plot_T_A_R_thicknesses() function in Project_3_11020606.ipynb. To create these files, CodeCarbon's EmissionsTracker output_file was manually set to the format outlined above, with the date and number of neutrons specified for that particular run. The cell containing the plot_T_A_R_thicknesses() function was then run multiple (approximately 10) times with the same output_file name. With each run, a new row of data is added to the corresponding XXXXXX_neutron_penetration_emissions_NNNNN.csv file. This process is repeated with different neutron numbers (ensuring the output_file name matches the neutron_number function argument).
